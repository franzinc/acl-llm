# Lisp API for Large Language Models

This is an evolving API that is used from Lisp, by both AllegroGraph
and Allegro Common Lisp, to access LLMs.  We are in the process of
expanding the offering beyond OpenAI.  Stay tuned for that.

## Branches

There are two different sets of branches:
 1. `master` :: used for Allegro CL
 1. branches based on the AllegroGraph version (e.g., `v8.2.1`)

Choose the appropriate branch, depending on whether you are an
AllegroGraph or Allegro CL user.
